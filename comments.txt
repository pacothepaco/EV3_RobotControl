 * timed motor operation:
   - What happens if motor is already operating at non-zero power?
     Does it go back to zero and start ramping-up?
     Should the function reset power to zero before starting timed op?

 * Sensor functions
   - Document what happens if a different sensor (or no sensor!) is plugged in the specified port

 * Describe within btcomm.h (maybe at the top, below the general header), how the functions you're
   using from the Lego dev kit work (e.g. the LCX() etc...) so students know what is going on where
   you're forming messages.
   
 * Why does the gyro sensor read function clear the sensor data? 
 
 * Please document within the gyro sensor read function what the numbers read mean (i.e. how do
   students use them or make sense of them?) maybe give a couple examples...
